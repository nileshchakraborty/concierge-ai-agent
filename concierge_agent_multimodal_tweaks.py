# concierge_agent.py
# A terminal-based AI agent that acts as a local concierge.
# It uses a local Gemma model served by Ollama for reasoning and external tools for web search and browsing.

2.  **Email Draft Instructions (if sending):**

    -   **Email Body:**
        -   Start with a brief, friendly opening.
        -   Present the key information from the final summary, likely as a bulleted list.

        -   **IMPORTANT:** If you can find a direct link for reservations, booking, or more information in the raw text, include it.

**Response Format:**
You MUST respond in a valid JSON format.
