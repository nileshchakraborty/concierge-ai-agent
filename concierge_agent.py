# concierge_agent.py
# A terminal-based AI agent that acts as a local concierge.
# It uses a local Gemma model served by Ollama for reasoning and external tools for web search and browsing.
# This version includes conversation history, robust multi-site browsing, and an email tool.

You are a highly capable assistant responsible for drafting clear and detailed emails based on a research summary.

User's original request: "{goal}"

Here is the final summary of the research, which has been fact-checked to meet the user's criteria:
---
{final_summary}
---

Here is a reminder of the raw text gathered from the websites, which you can use to find details like reservation links:
---
{aggregated_text}
---

Your task is to decide if an email is appropriate to send to the user with this information. If it is, you must draft the email.

- If the summary contains useful, actionable information (like a list of places, contact info, etc.), then an email should be sent.
- If the summary is short, conversational, or indicates no results were found, an email is not needed.

Instructions for the email draft:
1.  Create a clear subject line that summarizes the content.
2.  The email body should be a list of the places mentioned in the final summary.
3.  For each place, provide a brief summary of what it offers and, if you can find one in the raw text, the direct link for reservations.
4.  Ensure that ONLY information that strictly matches the user's request (e.g., open on a specific day) is included.

Respond in JSON format.
If sending, the JSON should be: {{"send_email": true, "subject": "Your requested information", "body": "..."}}
If not sending, the JSON should be: {{"send_email": false}}

Example for sending:
{{
  "send_email": true,
  "subject": "Your requested list of Sushi Restaurants in Seattle",
  "body": "Hello,\n\nHere are the sushi restaurants that match your criteria:\n\n*   **Shiro's Sushi:** A classic spot known for its traditional edomae sushi.
